# Samuel Kuczynski Bike Sharing

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this assignment was to help create a visual analysis to our investors on our bike-sharing program initiative in Des Moines. We were able to highlight key data taken from NYC Citibike that will help us make key decisions in starting up this company. We leveraged Tableau and Python to visualize and edit our data types. The main targets were to find user information spanning across Gender, Subscribers and length of trips.


## Results

### Peak Hours

#### The above graphic shows the peak hours for our data. The peak hours are 7 AM - 8 PM. For us to maximize our profits we are going to need our services running at max performance during this time. Bikes are easily damaged, so I recommend that we maintenance them during our off hours between 2 AM - 4 AM.  

### Checkout Times

#### The above graphic shows how long our users trips typically are. Our users are typically using our product for an average of 10-20 minutes. After this time our ride count significantly falls off. To ensure that we are giving the best product to our customer we would want to make sure we are strategically placing our bikes within 10-20 commuter minutes of larger companies. 

### Checkout Times by Gender

#### The above graphic shows the checkout times broken out by gender. Our customer base is largely male.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

#### The above graphic shows a heatmap of all our trips throughout the day. 

### User Trips

#### The above graphic shows the breakdown of Customer vs Subscriber on weekday usage. We see most of our Subscribers using our service for a daily commute while the non-subscriber customer is using our service more freelance. 

### Trips by Weekday per Hour by Gender

#### The above graphic shows a heatmap of all our trips throughout the day separated by Gender.

### Hotspot Locations

![Peak Finish](https://github.com/SKuczynski17/Bike_Sharing/blob/main/Images/Ride%20End%20Hotspots.png)
#### The above two graphics show the hotspots for ride start & finish locations. The blue graph is start while the red is finish. We would want to see if these locations are next to any major companies, and we can cross reference those HQ locations to Des Moines and see if we would have similar clientele wanting to bike into work.  

## Summary

#### Overall, I believe there is more analysis needed on this topic. I believe we have done great job of indicating success through New York City however I would want to start cross referencing these success points with what we have available in Des Moines. We would need to indicate a need for this type of transportation for typical 9-5 M-F workweeks as that is what is driving a lot of the profitability in NYC. The weekend traffic is extra but without that commuter demand I believe we would struggle to stay afloat to start off.
