# Samuel Kuczynski Bikesharing

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this assignemnt was to help create a visual analysis to our investors on our bike-sharing program initiative in Des Moines. We were able to highlight key data taken from NYC Citibike that will help us make key decisions in starting up this company. We leveraged Tableu and Python to visualize and edit our data types. The main targets were to find user information spanning across Gender, Subscribers and length of trips.


## Results

### Throughout this analysis we were able to deduct that the highest fares of rides were in the Urban cities, followed by Suburban and lowest for Rural. Along with being the highest cost we also saw the most rides coming out of the Urban area, potentially causing this increase in price. Some statistical differences between each city type are listed below.

## Summary

### Three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing disparities among the city types

#### I would primarily focus on expanding the product in the Rural/Suburban areas, we can see how much growth the Urban areas help drive PyBer as a whole. If PyBer can help sell additional rides in these smaller cities, it could help grow the company exponentially. One way that they could do this is by offering cheaper rides initially in these towns to get the individuals to understand the benefits. Then as we gain customer ship we can revert to our typical pricing and hopefully retain these same customers. To help supplement the increased demand in these smaller areas of rides; we are going to need to have enough drivers to support this as well. So from an investment standpoint we can take a loss on some of these rides as we gain market share in these areas, ensuring that our drivers are supported and dedicated to working for us in these smaller areas.
